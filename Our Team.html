                Students enjoy my encouraging attitude and they feel confident going into their exams due to my <strong>linear teaching style</strong>. <br> Less-confident students prefer me to strip their course down to the basics but top-achievers come to me for <strong>experience-based advice</strong> on how to achieve the top grades, find the best study resources, find gaps in their knowledge, and ensure the marks that they deserve. <br> I always work as hard as my students do and I provide a <strong>summary of the content covered and relevant practise questions</strong> to help my students organise their work and ensure they get the most out of my sessions.
                <br><br>
                I have a profound understanding of mathematics: I achieved a <strong>first class degree</strong> (88% average) at the University of Bristol, I won three <strong> awards for academic achievement</strong> (including one of two highest grades in the year), and I regularly write articles for howtosurviveamathsdegree.com. <br> In particular, I teach <strong>pure maths, algebra, foundational maths, and topology</strong> at an undergraduate level.<br> I have experience with the <strong>Cambridge International, AQA, and OCR</strong> A-Level Syllabuses, and the <strong>AQA core and foundational</strong> GCSE syllabuses.
                <br><br>
                I am <strong>fluent in French</strong>, having completed a year of my degree at <strong>Sorbonne University</strong>, Paris, and I currently reside in France. As a result, I have an impressive understanding of both <strong>formal and conversational French</strong>, as well as French culture. <br> I have tutored GCSE and A-Level French by following the <strong>AQA and WJEC syllabuses</strong> but university-level students enjoy my informal oral practise sessions before their semesters abroad, due to my detailed <strong>linguistic and cultural advice</strong>.
